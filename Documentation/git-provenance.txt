NAME
----

git-provenance - list the branches from which commits were cherry-picked

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git provenance' [-a] [-t[t]] [-v] [[-u <branchname>]...]
	       [[-i <istr>]...] [[-x <xstr>]...]
	       [<branch> [[<commitID>|<changeID>]...]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
For each commit in <branch> (default current branch) since the limb's
common kernel version, this command displays the commit's ID followed
by the commit ID and branch name of each provider commit from which
the commit was (recursively) cherry-picked.

The default output consists of a line containing the commit ID for
each commit in <branch> followed by a line for each provider commit
containing the provider commit's ID and branch name.  The provider
commit ID is preceded by whitespace and is separated from the provider
branch name by a space.

OPTIONS
-------
<branch>::
	The branch whose commits are to be displayed.  It defaults to
	the current branch.

<commitID>::
<changeID>::
	If any <commitID> or <changeID> arguments are given, the output
	is limited to commits in <branch> whose commit ID and/or changeID
	begins with <commitID> or <changeID>.

-a::
	Display abbreviated commit IDs.

-v::
	Verbose.  Append the commit's subject to the line for each commit
	in <branch>.

-t::
	Terse.  Display all information related to a commit in one line.
	The output will consist of one line for each commit in <branch>.
	If a second -t is specified, the information about provider
	branches is omitted from the output.

-i::
	Only display commits in <branch> whose provider branch names
	contain the substring <istr>.  To display all commits that
	were cherry-picked from any branch, use: -i "".

-x::
	Only display commits in <branch> whose provider branch names
	do not contain the substring <xstr>.  To display only commits
	that were not cherry-picked from any branch, use: -x "".

-u::
	Add an additional upstream reference provider branch <branchname>.
	Multiple -u options are permitted.
