NAME
----
git-signoff-mv - Add a sign-off or acked line to a set of commits

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git signoff-mv' [--ack] [--nack] [--name <name>] [--email <email>]
               [--bugz <bug_number>] [--disposition <disposition>]
	       [-f|--force] [--source <source>] [--type <type>] <rev-list>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'git signoff-mv' provides a method for a developer to add a line that 
reads "Signed-off-by: Name <Email>" to a set of commits in the current 
branch.

By default, the name and email are picked up from the command line
options below, but if they are not set, 'git signoff-mv' looks at the
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL environment variables and
if those are not set, it will read the the user.name and user.email
variables in 'git config'.

Note that doing this will rewrite the commits such that they have new
commit IDs as git commit IDs are based on the both the commit contents
and the commit message. This means that once 'git signoff-mv' is
completed, the branch will no longer be a 1:1 match with the original
branch.


OPTIONS
-------
--ack::
	Instead of a "Signed-off-by" line, add an "Acked-by" line.

--nack::
	Instead of a "Signed-off-by" line, add an "Nacked-by" line.

--name <name>::
	Use <name> as the name in the sign-off

--email <email>::
	Use <email> as the email in the sign-off

--bugz <bug_number>::
	Add a second bug number to the MR: line of the subheader.  Use when
	'git bulk-cherry' didn't do the right thing.

--disposition <disposition>::
	Value of Disposition: line to be added to the commit message subheader.

--source <source>::
	Value of Source: line to be added to the commit message subheader.

--type <type>::
	Value of Type: line to be added to the commit message subheader.

-f | --force::
	'git signoff-mv' uses 'git filter-branch' internally.  Sometimes
	'git filter-branch' refuses to overwrite the new branch without
	the -f or --force option.  'git signoff-mv' passes the -f or --force
	option directly to 'git filter-branch'.

<rev-list>::
	List of revisions to sign-off.


EXAMPLE
-------

------------
$ git checkout -b 27290_v01 f2.6.24/bugfixes/27290_v01 (1)
$ git signoff-mv --ack f2.6.24/dev.. (2)
------------

1. Checkoout out a local tracking branch for the remote bugfixes/27290_v01 
   based on the f2.6.24 remote repository.

2. Tell 'git signoff-mv' to add an "Acked-by:" line to each commit that
   is in the bugfix branch but not in the f2.6.24/dev branch.
