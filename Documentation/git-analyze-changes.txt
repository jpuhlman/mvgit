git-analyze-changes - Analyze the changes between two limbs

SYNOPSIS
--------
'git-analyze-changes' [-r <remote>] [[-u <branchname>]...]
		[-v] [-p] [-h] [[<limb1>..]<limb2>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Compares each of the commits in the branches that are common to
<limb1> and <limb2> and summarizes the changes, noting deleted,
modified and new commits.

OPTIONS
-------
<limb1>::
	The first limb to compare.  If it is omitted, the remote
	limb corresponding to <limb2> is used.

<limb2>::
	The second limb to compare.  If it is omitted, the repository's
	current limb is used.

-r::
	Specifies the remote alias to be used.  If it is omitted,
	a heuristic is used to determine the remote alias.  The
	heuristic may be overridden by specifying a value for the
	git config variable "mvista.remote-alias".

-v::
	Verbose.  Display the commit descriptions for each deleted,
	modified or new commit.

-p::
	Display the patch associated with each modified or new commit.
	This option implies -v.

-c::
	Display only commits that are "created".  Implies -v and -p.

-u::
	Add an additional upstream reference provider branch <branchname>.
	Multiple -u options are permitted.
