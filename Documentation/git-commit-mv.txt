NAME
----
git-commit-mv - git-commit with MontaVista extensions

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git-commit-mv' [-c <commit> [-x]] [--bugz <bugno>] [--type <string>]
	      [--disposition <string>] [--source <string>] [--oneline <string>]
	      [--bodyfile <file>] [--no-edit] [git-commit options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`git-commit-mv` is an extension on top of the standard `git-commit` command
that is aware of the MontaVista commit header format.

A commit generated with this command has the following format:

------------
Oneline summary of change, less then 60 characters

Source: MontaVista Software, LLC | URL | Some Guy <email@addr>
MR: <bugno>
Type: Defect Fix | Security Fix | Enhancement | Integration
Disposition: Submitted to | Needs submitting to | Merged from | Rejected by | Backport | Local | MontaVista
Description:

Verbose description of the change

Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@mvista.com>
------------

OPTIONS
-------
-C <commit>::
	Take existing commit object, and reuse the log message
	and the authorship information (including the timestamp)
	when creating the commit. 
-c <commit>::
	Same as -C <commit> above, but lets you edit the commit message. 
-x::
	Add a "(Cherry picked from <commit>)" when used with the -c option.

--bugz <bugno>::
	Fill in the "MR:" field of the MontaVista commit header with <bugno>.

--source <string>::
	Fill in the "Source:" field of the MontaVista commit header with the
	string specified in the command option.

--type <string>::
	Fill in the "Type:" field of the MontaVista commit header with the
	string specified in the command option.

--disposition <string>::
	Fill in the "Disposition:" field of the MontaVista commit header with the
	string specified in the command option.

--oneline <string>::
	Use the string specified in the command option as the subject/oneline 
	of the commit message. This option is primarilly intended for use
	by higher level automation scripts.

--bodyfile <file>::
	Use the file specified in the command option for the body of the 
	commit (the contents between the "Description:" sub-header and
	the final "Signed-off-by"

--no-edit::
	Do not run $GIT_EDITOR to edit the commit message but instead simply
	commit the changes with the header generated via the command line
	options. This option is primarilly inteded for use by higher level
	automation scripts.

--no-signoff::
	Default behavior is to add a Signed-off-by: line to the end of the
	commit message.  This option disables that.

--changeid <hash>::
	Don't use this option.  Let it be computed for you.  It's
	behind-the-scenes plumbing for the git-bulk-cherry-mv command.

DISCUSSION
----------

Any other options specified on the command line are passed directly to
`git-commit`, such that one can do `git-commit-mv [mv-options] -a` to commit
all local changes. Note that not all `git-commit` options are compatible
with `git-commit-mv`.


Note that no validation is done on the MontaVista-specific sub-header
fields at this time. This functionality will be added in the future.
