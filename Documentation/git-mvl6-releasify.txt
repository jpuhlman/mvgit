git-mvl6-releasify(1)
=====================

NAME
----

git-mvl6-releasify - generate a series of patches in
openembedded/bitbake format from the commits in a git repository.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mvl6-releasify' [options...] <committish> <output_dir>
    options:
	[-r <repo>]		Git repository to use
	[-s <since>]		Parent commit of patch series
	[-n || --dryrun]	Suppress output files
'git mvl6-releasify' --version

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Places a series of patches in <output_dir> corresponding to the commits
in <committish>, contained in the mvl6 git repository <repo>, a directory
on the local machine.  If <repo> is not specified, the current directory
is used.  The patch series begins with the first commit following <since>.
If <since> is not specified, the value contained in the file
MONTAVISTA/upstream_version of the limb-info branch in the same limb
as <committish> is used for <since>.

If <output_dir> exists and is not empty, 'git mvl6-releasify' fails
unless -f is specified.

The -n or --dry-run options can be used as a sanity check, while producing
no output files.
