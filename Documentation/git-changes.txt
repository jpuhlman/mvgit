NAME
----

git-changes - generate report on which changes need to propagate
through a limb.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git changes' [-v] -l [<limb>]
'git changes' [-v] [<left> [<right>]]
'git changes' --version

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program can be used to determine which changes should be
cherry-picked between branches in the limb. It has two modes of
operation. It can list all branches containing changes that should be
propagated to a particular branch, or it can list all of the commit
IDs of changes that should be propagated from one specified branch to
another.

'git changes' [-v] -l [<limb>]::

    The limb specified by <limb> (if omitted, the current limb) is
    examined.  Each of the limb's branches that has pending changes
    from one or more branches is listed, followed by the status of
    each branch on which it depends.  If -v is NOT specified, then each
    status appears only once.

'git changes' [-v] [<left-branch> [<right-branch>]]::

    If <left-branch> is not specified, the name of the current branch is
    listed, followed by the status of each branch on which it depends.
+
If <left-branch> is specified, the output is a list of commit IDs, one per
line, of commits in <left-branch> that are not in <right-branch> (the current
branch, if it is omitted) based on the Change IDs of the commits
in both branches.  If -v is specified, each commit's short description
is appended to the its commit ID.

Format of pending change status
-------------------------------

Each line of change status consists of two integers, separated by a
plus (+) sign, followed by the name of the branch containing the
pending changes.  The first integer is the number of pending commits
contained directly in the branch.  The second integer is the number of
pending commits contained in branches that that branch depends on
(recursively).

    Example:
	mvl-2.6.24/dev.x86
	    3 + 2 mvl-2.6.24/feature.rt

There are 3 commits in the mvl-2.6.24/feature.rt branch that haven't
been propagated to the mvl-2.6.24/dev.x86 branch, and there are 2
commits in branches that the mvl-2.6.24/feature.rt branch depends on
that haven't been propagated to the mvl-2.24/feature.rt branch.
